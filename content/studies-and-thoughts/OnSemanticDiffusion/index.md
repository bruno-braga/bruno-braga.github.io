## Breaking down the expression

Breaking an idea into its fundamental parts is an important step in my 
learning process. To understand 'Semantic Diffusion' we must first define 
its two halves.

Semantic, according to the online merriam-webster dictionary means:

> relating to significance or meaning

and Diffusion, according to the same dictionary:

> the state of being spread out or transmitted especially by contact : the 
> action of


With that in mind let's go to Martin Fowler definition:

> ...terms are vulnerable to losing their meaning, in a process of semantic 
> diffusion

Therefore, paraphrasing Fowler, semantic diffusion is the process in which 
terms lose their meaning.
 
## Thoughts on Semantic Diffusion

Funny enough, the first time I read the word diffusion I thought its meaning 
was closer related to the word lost or lose, that in fact, it is not wrong. Yet, 
even though you can use diffusion to refer to something being lost, because 
diffusion is the state of being spread out, it makes it difficult to understand 
because not necessarily something being spread will lose its meaning. Mainly 
because it's hard to measure how far the subject is going by just reading 
the word *diffusion*.

It is logical to see a poor choice of words as one the reason why this 
change of meaning happens, but, as Fowler states himself:

> Using a less desirable term may reduce semantic diffusion, but I don't 
> think it avoids the problem completely.

and I do agree with that, it does not avoid completely the problem, but we 
probably disagree in how much important that is, for instance, let's take a 
look at the term semantic diffusion:

As we saw a few lines above, Semantic Diffusion could be explained as how 
the meaning of an expression is spreaded out through groups of people. Yet, 
it fails communicating the meaning, because, it's hard to have a clear 
understanding that the **Diffusion** is corrupting the **Semantics** itself.

[//]: # (Agile is another good example. When we listen the word agile we 
probably think about words that are related to speed, but, agile does not 
focus on speed.)

I do really enjoy this article about semantic diffusion, but, after a few 
years of experience I feel something is missing there... 

So let's quote the author again:

> Semantic diffusion is essentially a succession of Chinese whispers where a 
> different group of people to the originators of a term start talking about 
> it without being careful about following the original definition.

By reading this other definition of semantic diffusion I can tell what was 
bugging me, the piece of the puzzle that I was missing. Fowler is talking 
about **how** semantic diffusion may happen in a way that seems to also 
explain why it happens, but no, while it is important to understand the 
process driving the change we also need to analyse **why** or **what** is 
causing the process to happen.

In order to understand why it happens let's take a closer look to the groups 
of people that play a role in that and also contextualize to our craft that 
is software development.

For now, I will stop here as I feel this needs more time to develop. I'll 
either be adding the continuation in here or I'll be making a part 2.
